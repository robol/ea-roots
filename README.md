# ea-roots
This repository hosts a simple and self-contained implementation of the Ehrlich-Aberth 
iteration for finding roots of polynomials. 

It implements a much more simplified version of the code in [MPSolve](https://github.com/robol/MPSolve), 
which is suitable for being included in other projects without adding a dependency, or for running simple 
tests / experiments.

The **examples** directory contains a few source files showing how to use the only 
function exposed by ea-roots.c, and a few checks are performed in the files in the 
**tests** directory.
